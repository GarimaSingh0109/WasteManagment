            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the difference between biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste?</h3>
                <p>Biodegradable waste refers to organic materials such as food scraps and garden waste that decompose naturally over time. Non-biodegradable waste includes plastics, metals, and other materials that do not decompose easily and require recycling or special disposal methods.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How can I reduce household waste?</h3>
                <p>You can reduce waste by buying reusable products, composting organic waste, recycling materials like plastic and paper, and avoiding single-use items. Participating in community waste reduction programs is also helpful.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should I do with hazardous waste?</h3>
                <p>Hazardous waste, such as batteries, chemicals, and electronic waste, should be taken to designated disposal sites or collection events. Do not dispose of them in regular household trash as they can be harmful to the environment.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can all plastics be recycled?</h3>
                <p>No, not all plastics are recyclable. Look for recycling symbols with numbers on plastic products. Most recycling centers accept plastics marked with numbers 1 and 2, but it's important to check with your local center for specific guidelines.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I start composting at home?</h3>
                <p>To start composting, collect food scraps like fruit peels, vegetable leftovers, and coffee grounds. Combine them with yard waste like leaves and grass clippings in a compost bin. Turn the compost regularly to ensure proper aeration and decomposition.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why is it important to sort waste?</h3>
                <p>Sorting waste ensures that recyclable materials like paper, glass, and plastics are properly processed, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. Proper sorting helps reduce pollution, conserve resources, and protect the environment.</p>
